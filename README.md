# Delete-Your-Youtube-Comments
Youtube doesn't provide a way to delete all your comments, so I made one!
Go to this url to view your comment history: https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/comment_history

Simply copy and paste the script in your dev tools and sit back as the cringe is gone!

Warning: This will permanently delete all your youtube comments once you run it with zero discrimination.
