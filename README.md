# How to automatically delete your youtube comments
Youtube doesn't provide a way to delete all your comments, so I made one! This will auto delete all your comments, at 1 comment every 400ms. Adjust the speed with the setInterval if you want to take time deleting your comments, I know you probably have some that are decades old and might want to just savior them one last time as you bid them farewell. 

## How to use the script: 
  Simply copy scriptSetup.js and paste it into your Chrome Dev Tools console while on your [comment history](https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/comment_history), and sit back as your comments dissolve into thin air!
